      <p>Hello, Everyone, my name is Eleanor Francois, and I am from the United States Virgin Islands. I was raised on 
        the island of St. Thomas. I attended St. Peter and Paul Catholic School. When I graduated, I attended Hampton 
        University in Hampton, VA. I participated in student government, the International Student Association, the NAACP,
        and the Hampton Players Theatre group there.<br>
        
        After graduating, I moved to Washington, DC. During my time in DC, I worked for Social Security for their Ticket 
        to Work Program, then as a contract Specialist for a software and imaging company. Working in these positions was 
        not fulfilling, and I decided to switch careers. I returned to school and took master's courses toward a degree in
         Secondary Education. I have since moved back to the Virgin Islands, working as a high school Social Studies 
         teacher at Charlotte Amalie High School.<br>
        
         I have been a member of the Social Studies Department at Charlotte Amalie High School since the Spring of 2011. 
         I have participated in several school-wide and district activities throughout this period: I am most proud of 
         revamping the social studies curriculum, which has allowed me to work with teachers in St. Thomas/St John and 
         St. Croix School Districts. I am also proud to have participated in the  Technology to Improve Teaching and 
         Learning (TITL) district task force to assist teachers in effectively incorporating technology in the classroom 
         and sharing that knowledge with our fellow teachers.<br>
      
         My new endeavor is to achieve my Masters's in Library and Information Science to become a school librarian. </p>

      <h1>About Me</h1><br>
      <p>Hello Everyone, my name is Eleanor Francois, and I am from the United States Virgin Islands. I was raised 
        on the island of St. Thomas. I attended St. Peter and Paul Catholic School. When I graduated, I attended 
        Hampton University in Hampton, VA. I participated in student government, the International Student Association, 
        the NAACP, and the Hampton Players Theatre group there. </p><br>
      <p>After graduating, I moved to Washington, DC. During my time in DC, I worked for Social Security for their Ticket 
        to Work Program, then as a contract Specialist for a software and imaging company. This was not fulfilling, and 
        I decided to switch careers. I returned to school and took master's courses toward a degree in Secondary Education.
         I have since moved back to the Virgin Islands, working as a high school Social Studies teacher at Charlotte Amalie
         High School.</p><br>
      <p>I have been a member of the Social Studies Department at Charlotte Amalie High School since the Spring of 2011. 
        I have participated in several school-wide and district activities throughout this period: I am most proud of 
        revamping the social studies curriculum, which has allowed me to work with teachers in St. Thomas/St John and 
        St. Croix School districts. I am also proud to have participated in the  Technology to Improve Teaching and 
        Learning (TITL) district task force to assist teachers in effectively incorporating technology in the classroom 
        and sharing that knowledge with our fellow teachers.</p><br>
      <p>My new endeavor is to achieve my Masters's and Library and Information Science to become a school librarian. </p>
